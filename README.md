### Create mocks for each screen:-Julie
Loading screen: Graphic Screen while the app is loading

Main Scene and Subcategory Screen: The Main Screen will have the list of categories. Subcategory Screen will look like the main screen but list the sub category items.

### Explain the value of the app for the user: - Safaraz
Being able to buy desired object and able to see it in real time with AR before purchasing. Example, if a user wants to buy a chair they can view it in AR to see if it can fit in their or if it looks good with their other furniture.

### Outline the users typical path through out the app:-Julie
The user will open the app and once the app is loading they will find themselves on the main scene. The main screen has a list of the different types of furniture they can choose to view, such as: couches, lamps, chairs, tables, etc.
The user can click on a category button which will bring them to a populated list of all the available item of that type. The prices and colour types will be listed along with an AR button.
If the AR button is pressed, the AR screen will load and the user will be able to place the chosen item in the area around them. The user can exit this mode by clicking the exit button.
The player can go back to the subcategory to click “Add To Cart” to add the item to their purchase.
There will be a Visit Cart button at the top of the screen to visit the current purchases. The total will be calculated.


### Discuss a few use cases- Dong
-	Let's say Julie wants to purchase a white closet in her room where some spaces are available and she wants test around before buying it from IKEA. By using this AR shopping app, she can generate objects through camera system and test around AR world.
-	Same for me too, I would like to buy a new bed frame. And I am not sure how big is this. By using bed frame AR objects to place at empty space and measure out. If that fits, I’m cool to buy this straight from IKEA, why not?
